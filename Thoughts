Parcel Priorities:  Parcels that have a delivery time requirement can have higher priority.  They would
complete before other files.  OR, they could be weighted higher so that if there is a low priority parcel between
two high priority files, then a stop could be arranged there.

Round trip:
Maybe for the first half of a trip, the truck would try to move further from the hub, and during the second half of
the trip, it could move closer to the hub.

Weighting: maybe instead of simply going for the next closest node, it could make a more complex decision
that takes into account whether the move would take the truck closer or further from the hub.
